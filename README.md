## Problem formulation

TODO

### Peculiarities of the recommendation problem

Recommendation is a different enough problem from classification and regression to have its own unique challenges.

* **Novelty should sometimes be taken into account**

* **Diversity should be taken into account**

* **Serendipity should be taken into account**

* **Often, recommender systems cannot be fully offline**

* **Production recommender systems should be mindful of presentation bias**

* **Production recommender systems should be robust**

* **The future is not always like the past**

## Main approaches for creating recommender systems
### Collaborative filtering
#### Algorithms
### Content-based filtering

Content-based recommender analyze item metadata and find
regularities in the content. They rely on the features of users and items for predictions. [[1]](#1).

#### Algorithms
### Hybrid approaches
#### Techniques
